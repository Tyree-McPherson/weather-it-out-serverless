# Weather It Out Serverless

Weather It Out is a weather application that uses the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API to get real-time weather data.

With the serverless backend being built in TypeScript, it provides a quick and easy backend to fetch the weather data and return it to the client. The serverless function is hosted on Microsoft Azure with Azure Functions.
